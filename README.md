> A carefully curated list of case studies on how the charity sector is utilising emerging AI technology like GenAI

We noticed that the charity sector is not utilising the power of GenAI to its full potential and in the private sector there are a lot of lists and examples that people can easily find.

Here we aim to curate a list of projects that can serve as inspiration for other charities and as cautious technolgoists, we would also highlight the risks and ethical considerations involved in such projects. Whenever possible, we ask the project owners and builders to clarify different aspects of the project.
